PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diabetes is a growing health concern in Nigeria, with many cases going
undiagnosed until serious complications arise. Early detection is critical
for effective management, but traditional screening methods are time-consuming
and require specialized medical expertise.

OBJECTIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To develop and compare three machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, SVM,
and Decision Tree) for automated diabetes classification, identifying the
most effective approach for clinical application.

METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Dataset: 768 patient records from Pima Indians Diabetes Database
• Features: 8 clinical measurements (glucose, BMI, age, etc.)
• Preprocessing: Missing value imputation, feature scaling
• Training: 80% training, 20% testing split
• Optimization: Grid Search with 5-fold cross-validation
• Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model Performance Comparison:
  Naive Bayes    : 70.13% accuracy, 0.5965 F1-Score
  SVM            : 69.48% accuracy, 0.5253 F1-Score
  Decision Tree  : 68.83% accuracy, 0.3684 F1-Score

Best Performing Model: Naive Bayes
  • Accuracy: 70.13%
  • F1-Score: 0.5965
  • Correctly identified 34 diabetic cases
  • Missed 20 diabetic cases

SIGNIFICANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Demonstrates feasibility of ML for diabetes screening
• Provides objective comparison of three algorithms
• Achieves clinically relevant accuracy levels
• Can support healthcare workers in resource-limited settings
• Enables faster, more accessible diabetes screening

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Validate with local Nigerian patient data
2. Conduct clinical trials in healthcare facilities
3. Integrate with existing health information systems
4. Train healthcare workers on system interpretation
5. Establish continuous monitoring and model updates

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This study successfully developed and compared three ML algorithms for
diabetes classification. The Naive Bayes emerged as the best performer,
achieving 70.13% accuracy. The system demonstrates
potential for supporting early diabetes detection in Nigerian healthcare
settings, pending further validation and clinical integration.
